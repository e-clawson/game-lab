This was a lab done for practice work as part of Per Scholas online software engineering bootcamp. 

We were given the task of making an interactive "game" using DOM Manipulation. We were given a blank JS file, and a preset HTML file and CSS file. We were allowed to make some minimal changes in the html file but the goal was to practice creating and manipulating everthing through the DOM/JS. 

This project was commpleted by Liz Clawson, Bousso Diallo, Cody Fountain, Jalen Young, and Khalid James. 

To open this file, open the file in VS Code, and open a port. (this project was created using go Live)
